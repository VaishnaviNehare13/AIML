        "\n",
        "In the given code, three different CSP strategies are implemented to solve the N-Queens problem. The first approach uses backtracking, where queens are placed column by column, and the algorithm backtracks whenever it encounters a conflict. The second approach enhances this by applying forward checking, which prunes invalid choices from future domains immediately after placing a queen, thereby avoiding dead ends early. The third approach applies a Min-Conflicts heuristic local search, which starts with a random configuration of queens and iteratively moves conflicted queens to positions with fewer conflicts until a solution is reached or the step limit is exceeded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these methods demonstrate different problem-solving strategies in CSP: backtracking provides completeness but can be slow, forward checking improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary exploration, and min-conflicts offers a fast heuristic-based solution well-suited for larger boards. This comparative implementation highlights the trade-offs between systematic search and heuristic local search in solving constraint satisfaction problems."
